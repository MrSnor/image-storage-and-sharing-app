  - **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to JavaScript for improved code quality and maintainability.  

- **Backend**:  
  - **Java 18**: The core programming language used for backend development.  
  - **Spring Boot**: A framework to simplify backend setup with built-in features like dependency injection, REST APIs, and web services.  

- **Database**:  
  - **PostgreSQL**: A robust and scalable relational database system used for storing images, metadata, and user information.  
  - **Docker**: Used for containerizing the PostgreSQL database to ensure consistent and isolated environments for development and deployment.

### 2. Project Structure  

**Frontend**:  
The frontend is built with Next.js, and it's organized as follows:

- **components/**: Contains reusable UI components like icons, modals, and carousels.  
- **pages/**: Contains the pages of the application, including dynamic routes for viewing individual photos.  
- **public/**: Stores static assets like the favicon and Open Graph images.  
- **styles/**: Holds global CSS styles for the application.  
- **utils/**: Utility functions and custom hooks for handling image management, caching, and more.

**Backend**:  
The backend is powered by Spring Boot and is organized into the following key packages:

- **controller/**: Manages API requests and handles user interactions.  
- **service/**: Contains business logic for image handling and user management.  
- **repository/**: Interfaces with the PostgreSQL database for image and user data storage.  
- **model/**: Defines data structures for images, users, etc.

**Database**:  
The PostgreSQL database is containerized using Docker to ensure easy deployment and consistency across environments.

This simplified structure provides a clean separation of concerns and ensures scalability as the application grows.

### Roadmap

- [ ] **Video Player**: Integrate a video player into the platform, enabling users to preview and play their video files directly within the app.

- [ ] **Multi-Select Operations**: Enable multi-selection of images or videos, allowing users to perform bulk actions like deletion, downloading, or sharing on multiple assets at once.  

- [ ] **Prevent Asset Duplication**: Implement a feature to automatically detect and prevent the duplication of uploaded photos and videos, ensuring the storage remains organized and efficient.  

- [ ] **View EXIF Data**: Provide users with the ability to view EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) data, giving them metadata about their photos such as camera settings and location.  

- [ ] **Admin Dashboard**: Develop a web-based admin portal that allows administrators to manage users, settings, and overall system configurations seamlessly.  

- [ ] **Album Sharing**: Introduce the ability for users to share entire albums with others, enabling collaboration and easy sharing of collections.  

- [ ] **Image Tagging**: Allow users to tag images with custom labels or keywords, improving the searchability and organization of their assets.  

### Best Practices

- **Code Documentation**: Ensure that all components, including frontend and backend code, are thoroughly documented to provide clarity on functionality and ease of future development.  
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling across both the frontend and backend to manage unexpected issues and provide a seamless user experience.  
- **Security Practices**: Prioritize secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring that all user data, especially sensitive media, is protected.  
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the frontend is responsive and optimized for various devices, enhancing accessibility for users across different platforms.  
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize database queries and frontend rendering to ensure fast loading times, even with large media libraries.  
- **Unit and Integration Testing**: Maintain a high level of testing coverage, including unit tests for backend services and integration tests for full-stack functionality, to guarantee application stability.
